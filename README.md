# Training-c
This is a repository in which I'll be posting my work training on the programming language c



## Notes.

-> The command gcc "filename.c" will compile your program and will create an executable called a. if you instead use the command gcc filename.c -o "AnyName" you will compile the program but the executable will have "AnyName" as a name.

-> It's very important that you check the full gcc docs for the full rundown on this compiler but for now, the compile command will be enough.
